  &ldquo;Tangible fragments of life&rdquo; -- &ldquo;oddball
  collections of trinkets amidst compendia of data&rdquo; --
  &ldquo;open-ended juxtapositions&rdquo;. All descriptions of the
  assemblage artwork by the American artist Joseph Cornell
  (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  Rarely leaving New York City, Joseph Cornell lived in a series of
  small houses in Queens, and devoted himself to caring for his mother
  and disabled brother. He assembled everyday found objects &mdash;
  marbles, paper, photos, wood, and glass &mdash; in shadow boxes
  creating evocative imaginary worlds.  His work is difficult to place
  within an art movement or style, and has inspired generations of
  American artists.
</p><p>
  While Joseph Cornell individually selected and juxtaposed tangible
  objects to express his personal statement, Blu Pen finds internet
  sources you can trust and displays their content in virtual visual
  collections stored for reading now or later. Stewart Culin, the late
  &ldquo;museum magician&rdquo; of the Brooklyn Museum, captured Blu
  Pen&rsquo;s essence well, we are &ldquo;preserving the seed of
  things which may blossom and fruit again&rdquo;.
</p><p>
  This collection, Blu Pen&rsquo;s first, originates from social media
  content from countries experiencing humanitarian crisis. The content
  forms a narrative not shaped by a curator, but forged by the
  internet itself. Insights and meaning are gained by the viewer as
  they navigate and explore the collection.

  Enjoy exploring and be inspired.
