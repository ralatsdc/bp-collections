<h2 class="bold">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
  Blu Pen&rsquo;s first series focuses on seven countries undergoing
  humanitarian crisis situations caused by natural disasters and
  political conflicts.
</p><p>
  For each series, we search among millions of internet sources by
  keywords, analyze thousands using factors such as community
  engagement and frequency of posts, and then collect content from the
  most trusted sources. We display the content in a sequence of four
  original d3 dynamic displays you navigate visually. For further
  exploration you can see a sample of each source author&rsquo;s
  content.  We have streamlined your finding, selecting, and
  organizing web content, to save you time reading the web content you
  care about.
</p><p>
  For this series, Blu Pen&rsquo;s first, we invite you to make a
  comparison between the content related to popular culture and
  content related to seven countries in crisis situations. We hope
  you&rsquo;ll discover new sources and delight in our surprising
  storehouses that prove &rdquo;the whole is other than the sum of its
  parts.&ldquo;
