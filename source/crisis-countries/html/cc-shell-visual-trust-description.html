    Circles represent a trusted source color coded by the social media
    service, and the amount of community engagement with each
    source. More engagement implies more trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trust is measured by a ratio. For Flickr, by the ratio of members
    to posts. For Tumblr, by the ratio of likes to posts. And for
    Twitter, by the ratio of followers to tweets.

  <p>
    More saturated colors indicate more trusted sources.
