  No single, static organization of content tames the quantity and
  complexity of internet content. It was reported in 2012 that every
  minute there were 100K Tweets created. Blu Pen addresses this flood
  by identifying trusted content and using visual diagrams sorted
  through filters of volume, trust, topics and frequency to streamline
  your internet experience.

<h4>How trusted is a source</h4>
<p>
  Trust is measured as the ratio of the number of members to posts
  (for Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the
  number of followers to tweets (for Twitter). Chart shows all trusted
  sources as circles keyed by social media service.  The darker the
  color the more trusted. To see the source identity hover over a
  circle, to view a sampling of the content, click the source
  identity.
