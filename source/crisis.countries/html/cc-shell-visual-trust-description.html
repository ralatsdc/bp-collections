  Trust is measured as the ratio of the number of members to posts
  (for Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the
  number of followers to tweets (for Twitter). Chart shows all trusted
  sources as circles keyed by social media service.  The darker the
  color, the more trusted the source. To see the source author hover
  over a circle, to view a sampling of the content, click within a
  circle.
