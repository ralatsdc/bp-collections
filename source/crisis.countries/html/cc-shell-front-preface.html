<h2 class="bold">PREFACE</h2>
<p>
  "Tangible fragments of life" -- "oddball collections of trinkets
  amidst compendia of data" -- "open-ended juxtapositions". All
  descriptions of the assemblage artwork by the American artist Joseph
  Cornell (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  In May 2014, Joseph Cornell's assemblage "Untitled (Penny Arcade
  Portrait of Lauren Bacall)" sold at a Christie's auction for $5.3
  million, setting an auction record for a work by this self-taught
  artist.
</p><p>
  Rarely leaving New York City, Joseph Cornell lived in a series of
  small houses in Queens, and devoted himself to caring for his mother
  and disabled brother. He assembled everyday found objects --
  marbles, paper, photos, wood, and glass -- in shadow boxes creating
  evocative imaginary worlds.  His work is difficult to place within
  an art ovement or style, and has inspired generations of American
  artists.
</p><p>
  Unlike Joseph Cornell who worked with physical objects, Blu-Pen
  works with virtual objects - content drawn from the internet, that
  vast compendium of everyday human expression.
</p><p>
  While Joseph Cornell individually selected and juxtaposed tangible
  objects to express his personal statement, Blu Pen assembles crowd
  selected content. Stewart Culin, the late "museum magician" of the
  Brooklyn Museum, captured Blu Pen's essense well, we are "preserving
  the seed of things which may blossom and fruit again".
</p><p>
  This collection, Blu Pen's first, orginates from social media
  content from countries experiencing humanitarian crisis. The content
  forms a narrative not shaped by a curator, but forged by the
  internet itself. Insignts and meaning are gained by the viewer as
  they navigate and explore the collection, a way that performs in the
  middle ground between print books, ebooks and websites.
</p><p>
  We hope you'll enjoy exploring and ultimately be inspired by this
  Blu Pen collection.
