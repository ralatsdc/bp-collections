<h2 class="bold">PREFACE</h2>
<p>
  "Tangible fragments of life" -- "oddball collections of trinkets
  amidst compendia of data" -- "open-ended juxtapositions". All
  descriptions of the assemblage artwork by the American artist Joseph
  Cornell (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  Rarely leaving New York City, Joseph Cornell lived in a series of
  small houses in Queens, and devoted himself to caring for his mother
  and disabled brother. He assembled everyday found objects --
  marbles, paper, photos, wood, and glass -- in shadow boxes creating
  evocative imaginary worlds.  His work is difficult to place within
  an art movement or style, and has inspired generations of American
  artists.
</p><p>
  While Joseph Cornell individually selected and juxtaposed tangible
  objects to express his personal statement, Blu Pen finds internet
  sources you can trust and displays their content in virtual visual
  collections stored for reading now or later. Stewart Culin, the late
  "museum magician" of the Brooklyn Museum, captured Blu Pen's essense
  well, we are "preserving the seed of things which may blossom and
  fruit again".
</p><p>
  This collection, Blu Pen's first, orginates from social media
  content from countries experiencing humanitarian crisis. The content
  forms a narrative not shaped by a curator, but forged by the
  internet itself. Insignts and meaning are gained by the viewer as
  they navigate and explore the collection.

  Enjoy exploring and be inspired.
