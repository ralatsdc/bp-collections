  Here's how to make a difference.
</p><p>
  "We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that
  silence can certainly kill."  Dr. James Orbinski, then-President of
  the MSF International Council, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize on
  behalf of MSF (Doctors Without Borders) in 1999.
</p><p>
  What then can we do to make a difference?
</p><p>
  Doctors Without Borders recommends a clear three step call to
  action: Get to Know Us, Get Involved, and Support Us.
</p>
<h2>Get to know us</h2>
<p>
  If you've spent time exploring the Crisis Collections you've started
  on the first step, Get to know us. You've probably gotten a sense
  for both what's being written about in social media for the crisis
  situation contrasted with what's going on in popular culture.

  from an organization or individual that interests you.
