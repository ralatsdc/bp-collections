<p>It might be lonelier<br>
  Without the Loneliness —<br>
  I’m so accustomed to my Fate —<br>
  Perhaps the Other — Peace —</p>
<p>Would interrupt the Dark —<br>
  And crowd the little Room —<br>
  Too scant — by Cubits — to contain<br>
  The Sacrament — of Him —</p>
<p>I am not used to Hope —<br>
  It might intrude upon —<br>
  It’s sweet parade — blaspheme the place —<br>
  Ordained to Suffering —</p>
<p>It might be easier<br>
  To fail — with Land in Sight —<br>
  Than gain — My Blue Peninsula —<br>
  To perish — of Delight —</p>
<p>— Emily Dickinson</p>
