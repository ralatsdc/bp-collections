  It might be lonelier</br>
  Without the Loneliness &mdash;</br>
  I&rsquo;m so accustomed to my Fate &mdash;</br>
  Perhaps the Other &mdash; Peace &mdash;
</p><p>
  Would interrupt the Dark &mdash;</br>
  And crowd the little Room &mdash;</br>
  Too scant &mdash; by Cubits &mdash; to contain</br>
  The Sacrament &mdash; of Him &mdash;
</p><p>
  I am not used to Hope &mdash;</br>
  It might intrude upon &mdash;</br>
  It&rsquo;s sweet parade &mdash; blaspheme the place &mdash;</br>
  Ordained to Suffering &mdash;
</p><p>
  It might be easier</br>
  To fail &mdash; with Land in Sight &mdash;</br>
  Than gain &mdash; My Blue Peninsula &mdash;</br>
  To perish &mdash; of Delight &mdash;
