  Chart shows all trusted sources collected. Colors indicate the
  social media service where the source content was created. Trust is
  measured as the ratio of the number of members to posts (for
  Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the number of
  followers to tweets (for Twitter). More saturated, darker, colors
  indicate more trusted sources.
