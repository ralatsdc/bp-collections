  Blu Pen strives to streamline the overwhelming flood of internet content
  by selecting, organizing, and displaying leading web content.
  One way Blu Pen does this is by identifying trusted sources.
  We measure trust as the ratio of the number of members to posts (for
  Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the number of
  followers to tweets (for Twitter).

  Circles are keyed by color to the social media service with
  darker colors indicating more trusted sources.

  No single, static organization of content tames the quantity and
  complexity of internet content. The following visual orgaanization
  provides access through doors of volume, trust, topics and
  frequency.

  Chart shows all trusted sources collected. Colors indicate the
  social media service where the source content was created. Trust is
  measured as the ratio of the number of members to posts (for
  Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the number of
  followers to tweets (for Twitter). More saturated, darker, colors
  indicate more trusted sources.
