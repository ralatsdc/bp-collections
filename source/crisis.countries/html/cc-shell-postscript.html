  How do we know what to do? Where do we find time to make a difference?
  How do we know if what we are doing makes a difference?

  Doctors without Borders make a clear three step call to action
  1) Get to know us
  2) Get involved
  3) Support us

  If you've investigated the crisis links that we've selected for this
  collection, you've taken the first step. You've seen a bit of what is going on
  in these countries and know a bit about what the problems are. You can find
  out more by signing up for a RSS feed from an aid agency such as Doctors
  without borders:
  http://www.msf.org.au/from-the-field/field-news/field-news/rss.xml

  If you're not sure what organization you would like to support, you can check
  out Charity Navigator, a non profit that works to guide intelligent giving.

  After you have selected an organization, you can get involved by volunteering,
  interning, or maybe even working for an organization. A good way to start
  is attending a meetings or events so you can learn more.

  And of course there is always giving.

  Here's three organizations that we picked and some links:
