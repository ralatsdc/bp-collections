  Here's how to make a difference.
</p>

  â€œWe are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence
  can certainly kill."
  Dr. James Orbinski, then-President of the MSF International Council, accepting
  the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of MSF (Doctors Without Borders) in 1999.

  What then can we do to make a difference?

  Doctors Without Borders recommends a clear three step call to action:
  Get to Know Us, Get Involved, and Support Us.

  Get to know us

  If you've spent time exploring the Crisis Collections you've started on the
  first step, Get to know us. You've probably gotten a sense for both what's
  being written about in social media for the crisis situation contrasted with
  what's going on in popular culture.

  A couple more things that you can do is sign up for the RSS feeds from an
  organization or individual that interests you.
