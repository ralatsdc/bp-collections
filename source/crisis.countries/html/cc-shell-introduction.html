<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>
  Blu Pen's first series focuses on seven countries undergoing
  humanitarian crisis situations caused by factors such as
  natural disasters and political
  conflicts.
</p><p>
  For each series, we search among the millions
  of internet sources by keywords, analyze thousands using factors
  such as community engagement and frequency of posts, and then collect the
  trusted content. We then take the content and display it in a sequence of
  four original d3 dynamic displays that you navigate visually. For further
  exploration you can see a sample of the source content.
  We have streamlined your finding, selecting, and
  organizing web content, to save you time reading the web content
  you care about.
</p><p>
  For this seriries, Blu Pen's first, we invite you to make a comparison between
  the content related to popular culture and content related to seven countries
  in crisis situations. We hope you&rsquo;ll discover new sources and delight in 
  our surprising
  storehouses that prove &rdquo;the whole is other than the sum of its
  parts.&ldquo;
