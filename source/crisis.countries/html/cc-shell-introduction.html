<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>
  Blu Pen's first series focuses on seven countries undergoing
  humanitarian crisis situations caused by factors such as
  natural disasters and political
  conflicts. We invite you to make a comparison between the content related to
  popular culture and content related to humanitarian issues.
</p><p>
  For each series, we search among the millions
  of internet sources by keywords, analyze thousands using factors
  such as community engagement and frequency of posts, then collect the trusted
  content
  in a sequence of original d3 dynamic displays that you navigate visually.
  We have streamlined your finding, selecting, and
  organizing web content, to save you time reading the web content
  you care about.

  You&rsquo;ll discover new sources and delight in our surprising
  storehouses that prove &rdquo;the whole is other than the sum of its
  parts.&ldquo;
