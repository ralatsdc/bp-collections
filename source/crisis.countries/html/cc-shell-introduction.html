<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>
  Blu Pen collects sources you can trust. We display a slice of their
  web content in beautiful visual collections stored for reading now
  or later.
</p><p>
  For each series, we search among the millions of internet sources,
  analyze thousands, and provide you with the best. We streamline your
  finding, selecting, and organizing web content, to save you time
  reading the web content you care about.
</p><p>
  We identify trusted sources by analyzing factors such as community
  interaction and frequency of posts, then collect the trusted content
  in original dynamic works that you navigate visually. If you can't
  read your collection now, you can read them later. There's no need
  to worry about missing something or being left behind.
</p><p>
  You&rsquo;ll discover new sources and delight in our surprising
  storehouses that prove &rdquo;the whole is other than the sum of its
  parts.&ldquo;
