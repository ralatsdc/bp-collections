  &ldquo;Tangible fragments of life&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;oddball
  collections of trinkets amidst compendia of data&rdquo; &mdash;
  &ldquo;open-ended juxtapositions&rdquo;. These are all descriptions of
  the artwork in the form of assemblages
  by the American artist Joseph Cornell (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  In May 2014, Joseph Cornell's assemblage “Untitled (Penny Arcade Portrait
  of Lauren Bacall)” sold at a Christie's auction for $5.3 million. This sale
  set an auction record for the self-taught American artist and was far
  different from anything Joseph Cornell experienced in his lifetime.
  Joseph Cornell lived in a series of small houses in Queens devoted
  to caring for his mother and disabled brother, rarely leaving New York City.
  With no formal
  art training, he assembled everyday found objects - marbles, paper, photos,
  wood, and glass - into evocative shadowboxes of imaginary worlds.
  His work is difficult to place within any art movement or style and
  has inspired generations of American artists.

  We too are inspired by Joseph Cornell and his obsession with assembling physical
  objects of everyday. But, unlike Joseph Cornell, Blu Pen uses virtual objects -
  online content drawn from that vast compendium
  of everyday human expression, better known as the internet. While Joseph Cornell
  individually selected and juxtaposed tangible objects to express his personal
  statement, Blu Pen assembles content that the community considers
  trusted. Our aim is like Stewart Culin, the late
  &ldquo;museum magician&rdquo; of the
  Brooklyn Museum, we are &ldquo;preserving the seed of things which
  may blossom and fruit again&rdquo;. The assembled Blu Pen collection is a
  narrative, not molded by a curator, but molded by the internet.
  Insignts and meaning are gained
  by the viewer as they navigate and explore the collection through
  Blu Pen's visual display.

  We hope you'll be inspired by this collection, Blu Pen's first.
