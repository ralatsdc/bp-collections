  "Tangible fragments of life" -- "oddball collections of trinkets
  amidst compendia of data" -- "open-ended juxtapositions". All
  descriptions of assemblages by the American artist Joseph Cornell
  (1903-1972). With no formal training, and while living with his
  mother and disabled brother in a small house in Flushing, Queens, he
  placed everyday objects in shadow boxes, in unexpected and evocative
  arrangements, creating art simultaneously above movements and
  styles, and ultimately influencing generations of American artists.

  The work of Joseph Cornell is an inspiration to Blue Peninsula as we
  work, not with the physical objects of everyday, but the virtual
  objects of the internet, that vast compendium of everyday human
  expression. Unlike Joseph Cornell, who sought to express a personal
  statement by his selection and juxtaposition of objects, Blue
  Peninsula seeks to create a visible storage of online content. Like
  Stewart Culin, the late "museum magician" of the Brooklyn Museum, we
  are "preserving the seed of things which may blossom and fruit
  again". The result is a personal narrative, not molded by a curator,
  but drawn by the viewerâ€™s experience of the grouping and analyzing
  the content as a whole.
