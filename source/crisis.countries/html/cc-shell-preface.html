  &ldquo;Tangible fragments of life&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;oddball
  collections of trinkets amidst compendia of data&rdquo; &mdash;
  &ldquo;open-ended juxtapositions&rdquo;. These are all descriptions of
  the artwork in the form of assemblages
  by the American artist Joseph Cornell (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  In May 2014, Joseph Cornell's assemblage “Untitled (Penny Arcade Portrait
  of Lauren Bacall)” sold at a Christie's auction for $5.3 million. This sale
  set an auction record for the self-taught American artist and was far
  different from anything Joseph Cornell experienced in his lifetime.

</p><p>
  Rarely leaving New York City, Joseph Cornell lived in a series of small houses
  in Queens devoted to caring for his mother and disabled brother,
  With no formal
  art training, he assembled everyday found objects - marbles, paper, photos,
  wood, and glass - into evocative shadowboxes of imaginary worlds.
  His work is difficult to place within any art movement or style and
  has inspired generations of American artists.

</p><p>
  Unlike Joseph Cornell who assembled physical objects of everyday, Blu Pen
  uses virtual objects - online content drawn from that vast compendium
  of everyday human expression, better known as the internet. While
  Joseph Cornell individually selected and juxtaposed tangible objects to
  express his personal statement, Blu Pen assembles crowd selected content.
  Stewart Culin, the late &ldquo;museum magician&rdquo; of the
  Brooklyn Museum, captured Blu Pen's essense well, we are &ldquo;preserving the
  seed of things which
  may blossom and fruit again&rdquo;.
</p><p>
  This collection, Blu Pen's first, orginates from social media content
  from countries experiencing humanitarian crisis. The content forms a
  narrative not shaped by a curator, but forged by the internet itself.
  Insignts and meaning are gained
  by the viewer as they navigate and explore the collection, a way that performs
  in the middle ground between print books, ebooks and websites.

  We hope you'll enjoy exploring and ultimately be inspired by this
  Blu Pen collection.
