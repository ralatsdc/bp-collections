  &ldquo;Tangible fragments of life&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;oddball
  collections of trinkets amidst compendia of data&rdquo; &mdash;
  &ldquo;open-ended juxtapositions&rdquo;. These are all descriptions of
  the artwork in the form of assemblages
  by the American artist Joseph Cornell (1903-1972).
</p><p>
  In May 2014, Joseph Cornell's assemblage “Untitled (Penny Arcade Portrait
  of Lauren Bacall)” sold at a Christie's auction for $5.3 million. This sale
  set an auction record for the self-taught American artist and was far
  different from anything Joseph Cornell experienced in his lifetime.
  Joseph Cornell lived in a series of small houses in Queens devoted
  to caring for his mother and disabled brother, rarely leaving New York City.
  With no formal
  art training, he assembled everyday found objects - marbles, paper, photos,
  wood, and glass - into evocative shadowboxes of imaginary worlds.
  His work is difficult to place within any art movement or style and
  has inspired generations of American artists.

  We too are inspired by Joseph Cornell and his obsession with assembling
  physical objects of everyday. But, unlike Joseph Cornell, Blu Pen uses
  virtual objects - online content drawn from that vast compendium
  of everyday human expression, better known as the internet. While
  Joseph Cornell individually selected and juxtaposed tangible objects to
  express his personal statement, Blu Pen assembles content that the community
  considers trusted. Our aim is like Stewart Culin, the late
  &ldquo;museum magician&rdquo; of the
  Brooklyn Museum, we are &ldquo;preserving the seed of things which
  may blossom and fruit again&rdquo;.

  This collection, Blu Pen's first, orginates from social media content
  pertaining to seven countries in humanitarian crisis. Blu Pen analyzes
  content to identify trusted sources from Flickr,
  Tumblr, and Twitter and displays the trusted content in original visual
  diagrams that gives rise to a narrative, not shaped by a curator, but shaped
  by the internet itself. Insignts and meaning are gained
  by the viewer as they navigate and explore the collection, a way we believe
  is in the middle ground between the print book and a website and is
  a new way to interact and navigate through the content.

  We hope you'll enjoy exploring and ultimately be inspired by this
  Blu Pen collection.
