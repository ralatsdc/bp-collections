  No single, static organization of content tames the quantity and
  complexity of internet content. It was reported in 2012 that every
  minute there were 100K Tweets created. Blu Pen addresses this flood
  by identifying trusted content and using visual diagrams sorted
  through filters of volume, trust, topics and frequency to streamline
  your internet experience.
