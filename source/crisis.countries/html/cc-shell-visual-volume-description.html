  No single, static organization of content tames the quantity and
  complexity of internet content. It was reported in 2012 that every
  minute there were 100K Tweets created. Blu Pen addresses this flood
  by identifying trusted content and using visual diagrams sorted
  through filters of volume, trust, topics and frequency to streamline
  your internet experience.

<h4>How much Content is Produced</h4>

  Circles represent a trusted source, sized according to the amount of
  content (photos, posts, or tweets) the source produced. To see the
  source identity hover over a circle, to view a sampling of the
  content, click the source identity.
