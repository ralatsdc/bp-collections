<h3>How trusted is a source</h3>
<p>
  Trust is measured as the ratio of the number of members to posts
  (for Flickr), the number of likes to posts (for Tumblr), or the number of
  followers to tweets (for Twitter). Chart shows all trusted sources as
  circles keyed by social media service.
  The darker the color the more trusted. To
  see the source identity hover over a circle, to view a sampling of the
  content, click the source identity.
