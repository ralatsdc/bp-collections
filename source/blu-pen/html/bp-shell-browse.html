THE CRISIS COLLECTION – ONEBlu Pen’s Crisis Collection was conceived and built to engage readers in globalcrisis situations. We were inspired to explore online content tagged with crisisterms contrasted with the popular content of the country. We used the latesttechologies so our collections are fast, responsive, and compatible across allcomputers, tablets, and mobile devices.Our plan is to release in serial form, The Crisis Collection. Our series willpreserve trusted content, while keeping you up with the new. Let us know whatyou think!
