<div class="bp-shell-content">  <h2 class="comfortaabold">THE CRISIS COLLECTION &mdash; ONE</h2>  <p>    Blu Pen&rsquo;s Crisis Collection was conceived and built to    engage readers in global crisis situations. We were inspired to    explore online content tagged with crisis terms contrasted with    the popular content of the country. We used the latest techologies    so our collections are fast, responsive, and compatible across all    computers, tablets, and mobile devices.  </p><p>    Our plan is to release in serial form, The Crisis Collection. Our    series will preserve trusted content, while keeping you up with    the new. Let us know what you think!  </p></div><div class="row">  <div class="one-third column alpha bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-car">  </div>  <div class="one-third column bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-haiti">  </div>  <div class="one-third column omega bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-japan">  </div></div><div class="row">  <div class="one-third column alpha bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-philippines">  </div>  <div class="one-third column bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-south-sudan">  </div>  <div class="one-third column omega bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-syria">  </div></div><div class="row">  <div class="one-third column alpha bp-shell-collection" id="bp-shell-collection-source-zimbabwe">  </div></div>
