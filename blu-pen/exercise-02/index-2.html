          <p><strong>On the 26th of April, young people from all over the country came together at the University of Auckland to take part in the UN Youth&#8217;s, 2014 Youth Declaration event.</strong></p>
<p>Julie Watson, a Human Rights Specialist at the Commission was invited to speak to aspiring young leaders at the &#8216;<strong>2014 Youth Declaration</strong>&#8216; about active citizenship and human rights as part of a four-day national conference for secondary school students, which took place between Wednesday 23rd – Saturday 26th of April. The conference, which is facilitated by the <strong>UN Youth</strong>, was set up with the aim of creating an avenue for young aspiring leaders to express views on issues of public policy in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Participants at the conference were divided into Focus Groups, reflective of ten policy categories. These included: Social Services, Environmental Change, Education &amp; Science, Youth Development, Active Citizenship, and Foreign Affairs among others.</p>
<p>These Focus Groups encouraged the young aspiring leaders to engage in high quality debate and discussion, and as part of this UN Youth invited experts to speak to each focus group, and to offer informed perspectives on policy areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/901414_691632587564698_6661435423509753318_o.jpg" rel="lightbox[10184]" title="Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration"><img alt="901414 691632587564698 6661435423509753318 o Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration" class="wp-image-10191 aligncenter" height="284" src="http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/901414_691632587564698_6661435423509753318_o.jpg" title="Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration" width="425" /></a></p>
<p>Human Rights Specialist Julie Watson was invited to speak as one of these experts and spent Thursday morning with the aspiring leaders who made up the Citizenship and Rights Focus Group. She discussed her experiences at the Human Rights Commission with the students while also touching on a variety of current human rights issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1522703_691632667564690_156323966078597077_o.jpg" rel="lightbox[10184]" title="Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration"><img alt="1522703 691632667564690 156323966078597077 o Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration" class="wp-image-10192 aligncenter" height="283" src="http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1522703_691632667564690_156323966078597077_o.jpg" title="Commission makes an appearance at the 2014 Youth Declaration" width="425" /></a></p>
<p>UN Youth commended Julie for her Focus Group presentation stating that she &#8220;has truly opened up [the students] minds to different perspectives&#8230; through her knowledge, kindness, and dedication.&#8221;</p>

          <p><b>An 80-year-old granddad in the United States has had an equal rights symbol tattooed on his wrist to show his support for his gay grandson.</b></p>
<p>The man named only as “Grandpa Frank” got the Human Rights Campaign sign in ink, as you can see in the video included below.</p>
<p>Grandpa Frank explained his rationale for getting the tattoo, commenting  that “this pain is nothing to what my grandson went through when he first came out,”</p>
<p>“That had to be traumatic and I felt bad, but for the whole family to come together and support him &#8230; it was just fantastic.”</p>
<p>The tattoo matched one that his grandson has near his hip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see that age is not a barrier to understanding.  His grandson Joe is fortunate to have people like Frank, who not only love unconditionally, but also accept everyone for who they are.</p>

          <p>On the 11th of April Disability Rights Commissioner Paul Gibson and Human Rights Specialist Julie Watson traveled to Waitakere College to present their Indian Culture Group with the Te Urunga Award for Inclusiveness during their school assembly.</p>
<p>The group consisting of 22 members, included Snehal Mevasia and Ashwant Naidu, two students from the from the schools&#8217; Inclusion Support Centre, who wowed Polyfest attendees with their mix of traditional and Bollywood style dance.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission was equally impressed with Julie Watson commenting that  the Indian Culture Group showed inclusiveness of students both disabled and non-disabled in such a way that each member of the group is valued for their contribution to the performance.</p>
<p>Commissioner Paul Gibson spoke of how it is important for everyone to know their rights, but equally important to recognise that that comes with responsibilities.</p>

          <p>A provocative and thought provoking speech on race relations has won Thai An Vo top place over 180 students in the National finals of the annual NZ Race Unity Speech Awards held last weekend.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The students were tasked with explaining how they related to race relations in New Zealand by interpreting a traditional Maori proverb and a quotation on unity.</p>
<p>But it was Thai An’s<i> </i>speech that impressed chief judge Superintendent Wallace Haumaha and panel including Race Relations Commissioner, Dame Susan Devoy and  Berlinda Chin, director of the Office of Ethnic Affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thai An&#8217;s speech was truly thought-provoking and engaging.  His perspective on moving forward together as a multi-cultural nation was entirely pragmatic and practical. His comment that &#8216;the biggest changes can never come without the small ones&#8217; absolutely resonates,&#8221; said Superintendent Wallace Haumaha.</p>

          <p>On Friday the 4th of April, the annual Summerz End Youth Fest roared back into life hosting a range of great music performances including Titanium.</p>
<p>Each year the Summerz End Youth Fest is held with the aim of bridging the gap between youth from all walks of life and our communities, by creating a sense of belonging through connecting our common cultures.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Festival attendees were able to attend variety of workshops from African drumming, DJ-ing, “popping” dance, Indian dance, as well as mess around at fun photo booths (including an “I am Aotearoa New Zealand” themed one!).</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Festival, the organisers ran an &#8216;Art Mile project&#8217;, with the theme for this year being &#8216;Multicultural&#8217;. This was chosen to reflect the increasingly diverse nature of Christchurch and give everyone the ability to showcase and share their identity, regardless of their ethnic background.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I Am Aotearoa New Zealand&#8221; Mural:</h3>
<p>The Summerz End Youth Fest volunteers and Commission staff came together to plan this fantastic mural, made up of individual portraits, which illustrates the theme for Race Relation Day:</p>
